This statement is less true for the field of AI given how bustling it is and the fact that everything gets posted to ArXiv, but a lot of research out there in academia really doesn&amp;#39;t get read much if at all. More importantly, what I find valuable in reading older papers is not the explicit ideas that they had at the time, but moreso the potential that we in the present may have new interesting ideas that can spring off of what they might&amp;#39;ve assumed was a dead end.

Also, fractals don&amp;#39;t have to hold to all scales, so even on truncating (2) to a finite sum you still could have difficulties differentiating. Basically even if it is not strictly nondifferentiable, you could still have (f(x+h)-f(x))/h returns garbage data for 1e-10&amp;lt;h&amp;lt;1. This is the same reason why you can claim various real world objects are fractal despite being made of atoms, you just have some range of length scales where your system exhibits fractal structure, and you allow the fractal dimension to depend on length scale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But IMO we should still be perfectly happy to do the experimental mathematics, &amp;quot;just do it with millions of dollars of compute and see if it works,&amp;quot; though. Differentiability isn&amp;#39;t something I expect to be at the heart of why modern giant ML models are smart, but maybe that&amp;#39;s a radical position? I dunno, I did grad school for physics not ML lol.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yknow what I&amp;#39;m going to add something to my weekend project list: &amp;quot;Experimentally run gradient descent approximations on various fractal functions like f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2^(-n) cos(3^n x)&amp;quot; :D</textDisplay><replies><reply><authorChannelId>UCreEwqXawASORfKL53ipqYg</authorChannelId><textDisplay>also subscribed and thumbed up thanks for posting this and stimulating discussion!</textDisplay></reply><reply><authorChannelId>UCeQhm8DwHBg_YEYY0KGM1GQ</authorChannelId><textDisplay>yooooo if you run that experiment PLEASE join my discord and talk about it that&amp;#39;d be so hype. thanks for the amazing comment happy to have you!</textDisplay></reply></replies></comment><comment><videoId>kBAVP0zWfPM</videoId><authorChannelId>UCg2QB6xTEN9OpdBBAPOvyHw</authorChannelId><textDisplay>of course, I liked and subscribed. done and done.

I didn&amp;#39;t really understand what you meant when you said previously that the loss landscape was fractal in nature, because I thought you were talking about non-looping neural networks (which have bounded output gradients and therefore cannot be fractal, although still probably very complex), but now I realize that they can indeed be fractal in nature if the form closed loops. Well predicted.</textDisplay><replies><reply><authorChannelId>UCeQhm8DwHBg_YEYY0KGM1GQ</authorChannelId><textDisplay>hahaha yes I definitely wasn&amp;#39;t fully connecting all the dots when I glazed over the recursion part. The fractal loss landscape idea initially came to me in reference to an architecture design idea I had (a much newer and significantly different version of my triple hierarchical GPT decoder video) which does include recursion. My attempt to look for the same phenomenon in GPT-2 was misguided insofar as GPT2 lacks said recursion and I was overlooking that, essentially unrealistically hoping to find a shortcut to a cool result. Anyways, be on the lookout for the next version of that architecture. It incorporates a kind of recursion as well as some ideas from my hypersphere video, and I&amp;#39;m very optimistic about both its capabilities and what it might teach us about how these models work. Haven&amp;#39;t even written out the PyTorch layers yet though so still definitely at least a month away from a final product.

The work I&amp;#39;m referring to is this: &lt;a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/decoupled-neural-interfaces-using-synthetic-gradients/"&gt;https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/decoupled-neural-interfaces-using-synthetic-gradients/&lt;/a&gt;</textDisplay></reply><reply><authorChannelId>UCeQhm8DwHBg_YEYY0KGM1GQ</authorChannelId><textDisplay>Ok so I just read that link, it seems to me like the concepts are intricately related. Deepmind trained a simple model that can look at a small local portion of a network and predict a local gradient for that layer, whereas the velo model looks at an entire model and acts as a complete optimization algorithm replacement. So as far as I can tell they&amp;#39;re doing the essentially same thing, but either looking at the model globally vs locally.

Feel free to disagree but I believe it&amp;#39;s always best to assume that I don&amp;#39;t know the first thing about what&amp;#39;s going on and that other people may know and experience different and valuable things; that I could learn from them if I give them the chance to change my mind, which I&amp;#39;d be happy for you to do to me right now if you&amp;#39;re right. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to suggest that maybe you&amp;#39;re just not very good at asking the right questions in conversation to tease out people&amp;#39;s true thoughts, feelings, personalities, etc? Maybe they&amp;#39;re just as much of a main character as you are but neither of you have a high enough speech skill to convey to each other how exactly you&amp;#39;ve chosen to approach skill progression in this RPG. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I appreciate your obvious passion about the subject though as well as the video engagement and look forward to the possibility of being persuaded to your argument</textDisplay></reply></replies></comment><comment><videoId>soKGo3pIb1c</videoId><authorChannelId>UCjBdzGNNcm0lolmdxnp9A0A</authorChannelId><textDisplay>Super cool to see this type of content on Youtube.

I don&amp;#39;t think it follows that one must &amp;quot;surpass statistics&amp;quot; to create the model. In fact, I think what has been shown is that statistics are sufficient to produce said models, just not merely &amp;#39;surface&amp;#39; level statistics, although this terminology may be vague. &lt;br&gt;If we assume that this is not qualitatively different from the kind of modeling going on in the brain, it follows that the models used by the brain are similarly reducible to statistics. (However we may want to distinguishing between unconscious models like that which the cerebellum uses to help us balance and mental models like using the &amp;quot;Mind Palace&amp;quot; memory technique to visualize a space in one&amp;#39;s minds eye, as I&amp;#39;m unsure how qualia would be reducible to statistics, or what that would even mean.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The possible critique of this view which springs to mind is Penrose&amp;#39;s view that Gödel&amp;#39;s Incompleteness theorems demonstrate human&amp;#39;s ability to reason independent of any formal axiomatic system, as we are easily able to see that Gödel sentences are unprovable, even if the formalism itself cannot.&lt;br&gt;That said, this may be possible to solve if we consider that we are able to work not merely within the space of only one formalism, but within the set of all possible formalisms and compare them with model theoretic rules of inference, like parsimoniousness and the like. Does this ability fall within the set of computable functions?

Today&amp;#39;s LLMs might be somewhat close to a copy, but that&amp;#39;s because we train them like that for the lack of a better idea.&lt;br&gt;But what we really need is a system that can control (write programs and use existing tools) a computer freakin&amp;#39; well, given a goal that it needs to achieve.&lt;br&gt;So we want to be able to communicate our ideas to them efficiently and accurately, and we also want them to be able to communicate back to us their understanding of what we want them to do in a way that shows us that they get it before they start working on a problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;How do we best collect data for this project?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Good training data could be created if we had a system with which we can do useful tasks already with a very fast two-way communication.&lt;br&gt;Like practicing a language, while talking with it about my goals, why I have them, how did they evolve over time etc.&lt;br&gt;What we have right now from openai is not gonna cut it, it&amp;#39;s very annoying that I have to say everything that I want at once and I have to say ohm, well and things like that in order to avoid sending an incomplete audio because I still need more time to think of a word and whatnot.&lt;br&gt;Another example would be to let it control my mouse and keyboard while I&amp;#39;m talking to it what I want it to do (it has webcams to see my face and hand gestures and also gets to see the screen). First just moving the mouse to a location, make a click, then when it&amp;#39;s doing it with high success rate, let&amp;#39;s give it more freedom by doing more stuff at once etc. If it misundertands us then we correct them and that it&amp;#39;ll understand us better the next time we do something similar.&lt;br&gt;So the key I think is to start making them help us better and making our lives more convenient. The more you use such a system, the better it will help you, so you want to use it even more. We need to have such a positive feedback loop in order to make people crave to use such a system :D&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nofreewill42/UserIORecorder"&gt;https://github.com/nofreewill42/UserIORecorder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RLHF is so bad, we should make a system where we can tell it exactly why is one response better than another for us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;What kind of model architecture would best facilitate such a process?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;m thinking about having higher level &amp;quot;ideas&amp;quot; instead of tokens right away. Like me writing this text is not like I write it and it&amp;#39;s done, I&amp;#39;m constantly trying to match the idea that I have in my head, and also shaping the idea by what gets to be written down. If what I&amp;#39;ve written turned out not matching what I wanted, then I rewrite it. I sometimes think about how we could make our models less reliant about the exact text that is trying to describe an idea as there is a lot of ways how an idea could be written in words that are equally good. But I don&amp;#39;t really know yet how I would start doing this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;that slowly gets to be a higher resolution and learns like a child despite having your personality trains from a beginning?&amp;quot;  - (trains means traits?)&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really understand what you&amp;#39;re asking here, could you please clarify?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;What effect would that have on our psychology&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#39;s a good question.

Now you have people working to discredit people instead of working to discover new paradigms, new technologies etc... what a waste of time and money.

If you think of an AI art bot then what it must be doing is encoding a prompt to an embedding, then decoding that to an image. But it can&amp;#39;t respond to teh prompt in the same way as chatGPT can, because chatGPT decodes the embedding into a &amp;quot;next token&amp;quot;. So you have very different training data, and the embeddings are not compatible. So my suggestion was to train a third AI to translate from one embedding space to another. So if you say to chatGPT &amp;quot;draw me an image of a cat&amp;quot;, it can&amp;#39;t because it has no way to draw. But now you could say to Midjourney &amp;quot;/imagine a cat&amp;quot; and it could draw it. Now if you take theinternal state of both systems they should be equivalent so you can make a mapping from one to theother.,&lt;br&gt;Then the interesting part is when you give chatGPT a very complex prompt, which Midjourney cannot understand, an then map chatGPT state to MJ state</textDisplay></reply><reply><authorChannelId>UCeQhm8DwHBg_YEYY0KGM1GQ</authorChannelId><textDisplay>Would it not be more efficient to just ask chatGPT to write you a mid journey prompt? :P &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not completely sure how this mapping would work. For example, when you provide the same prompt and chatGPT replies &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, I have no way of actually drawing an image,&amp;quot; and mid journey replies with an actual image of a cat, then it certainly wouldn&amp;#39;t make sense to map one output to the other since they&amp;#39;re very different concepts, and midjourney likely has no place in its embedding space that looks anything like  the concept of &amp;quot;not being able to draw an image.&amp;quot; That rules out a possibility of an intermediate model mapping between output embedding spaces, although I think maybe your idea could work for inputs, but again why not just use ChatGPT as model B by asking it to write you a mid journey prompt?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the real utility here with multi-modality comes with one model being able to do calculations on both input text and an input image. My understanding of multi-modality as it stands is that we can have for example two input streams, a middle that is combined, and then two output streams. So kinda like the shape &amp;gt;-------&amp;lt; and that this allows us to do things like ask a question about a provided image.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cool thought though; I have a feeling I&amp;#39;m still not grasping the full potential of what you&amp;#39;re saying. Would love to hear more in the future!</textDisplay></reply><reply><authorChannelId>UCpaoen4mRE-5KrKzdt8XqLw</authorChannelId><textDisplay>@@Tunadorable yes, this is an interesting discussion. OK, so maybe the examples I gave to illustrate (no pun intended) might have had you confused. What was really getting at is to map the embedding state of one system directly to an embedded state of another system, bypassing the input and output stages. So introduce a third system which learns how to do this mapping.&lt;br&gt;I find it somewhat difficult to imagine what the results of this would be, so finding examples is not easy, but let&amp;#39;s suppose you had an English ChatGPT, and a French ChatGPT. Now if you want to get them to communicate with each other, the English ChatGPT could translate into French and send the output to the French GPT, who could then respond and translate the response back to English (let&amp;#39;s suppose the translation only works one way), But now you have to train both systems to do the forward translation. &lt;br&gt;However, if you inserted a system between them, it could learn to map the English language embedding into a corresponding French language embedding and vice versa. In other words, the third system becomes a bilingual translator. Now you don&amp;#39;t need to do anything else. &lt;br&gt;The English chatGPT can run completely in English, the French ChatGPT can operate entirely in French, and the intermediary system learns to become this bilingual translator. And how does it do this? By machine learning! It learns these mappings by being trained. It doesn&amp;#39;t need to know anything about English or French, its inputs and outputs are just two embedded states.&lt;br&gt;How you would actually do the training to ensure the states map correctly, I don&amp;#39;t know. &lt;br&gt;Like I said i am trying to think of examples, and this is a very poor one becausechatGPT can do all of this internally, hence why my earlier example was with different modalities,language and image, A more interesting example might be connecting an image AI with a mussic AI, you show a picture to the  image AI and its embedded state is mapped toa state in the music AI. So you show the image AIa &amp;quot;sad&amp;quot; image and the music AI generates sad music, show it an image of people at a party it statrs making happy party music.,  and then progress to image sequences and you have a system for generating movie soundtracks, perhaps.</textDisplay></reply><reply><authorChannelId>UCeQhm8DwHBg_YEYY0KGM1GQ</authorChannelId><textDisplay>@@salsaman Loving the discussion. Feel free to bow out at any time but I&amp;#39;ll pick your brain for as long as you let me bc I like your ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I think in the language case this would be pretty easy to train - just use google translate or human translators to compose a dataset of equivalent French &amp;amp; English sentences, get each of their embeddings for the French and English chatGPT models, and then yes a deep network should be able to pretty easily map one to the other and the calculations could even be run in reverse. Interestingly, I wonder if in this scenario it&amp;#39;d be helpful to do backdrop in both directions for a given data point? Might speed up training quite a bit to make this combination of two systems rather than training one larger model to simultaneously learn both languages. Very cool idea you&amp;#39;ve got going&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, I&amp;#39;m not as clear how you&amp;#39;d construct such a dataset for fundamentally different modalities, as you said images and music. Many concepts in each embedding space wouldn&amp;#39;t have any corresponding potential representation in the other embedding space, so they&amp;#39;d essentially get lost and just function as noise in the training data. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, to jump off your idea of just picking up the idea of &amp;quot;sad&amp;quot; in both a photo and in music, I think there&amp;#39;s some potential here. Take whatever image and music datasets you want to do this for and run them through pre-existing classification models to get labels for &amp;quot;sad,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;happy,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;angry,&amp;quot; etc images and music. Then train your embedding &amp;quot;bridge&amp;quot; model with the goal of only translating the sadness vector or emotion subspace between the two embedding spaces. Now you&amp;#39;ve got a model to translate this subspace. The only major problem I see with this working is the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (there&amp;#39;s vastly more information in a given image or song than just the emotion it conveys). However assuming we get past that, the real problem I see is purpose. What exactly would you use this emotion-specific image-music embedding space translation model for? To that end I still think the regular &amp;gt;----&amp;lt; model structure I brought up earlier still has more utility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lmk your thoughts, I could happily poke around for holes all day cuz you&amp;#39;ve got some interesting ideas.</textDisplay></reply></replies></comment><comment><videoId>3TOEBw4x2mo</videoId><authorChannelId>UCfytgj1ay9QebhilPgn1uZg</authorChannelId><textDisplay>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TOEBw4x2mo&amp;amp;t=3m01s"&gt;3:01&lt;/a&gt; think making language model cheaper is quite foundational because current artificial neural networks are comparable energy inefficient compared to the brain indicating that their underlying computational paradigm is different though right now it is treated as engineering problem additionally efficiency impact the scaling of models.</textDisplay><replies><reply><authorChannelId>UCeQhm8DwHBg_YEYY0KGM1GQ</authorChannelId><textDisplay>great point. but is their computational paradigm inefficient, or their computational substrate? there was a veritasium video awhile back talking about how if we switch from running the linear algebra as software on a GPU to embedding the weights within the voltages of a circuit then the energy consumption becomes negligible. however, this does require specialized hardware and the willingness to never update the model again. i predict that there will be many more ways invented to do this stuff, and within 2 or 3 years we’ll probably be running GPT4 if not 5 locally on our smartphones</textDisplay></reply><reply><authorChannelId>UCpaoen4mRE-5KrKzdt8XqLw</authorChannelId><textDisplay>@@Tunadorable not suggesting this as a practical solution, but a chatGPT using hydraulics would be fun, there are precedents for this  &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MONIAC"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MONIAC&lt;/a&gt;</textDisplay></reply><reply><authorChannelId>UCeQhm8DwHBg_YEYY0KGM1GQ</authorChannelId><textDisplay>@@salsaman hahahaha so fun.

They explain how today&amp;#39;s AI still just comes down to mathematical computations, rather than truly thinking like a human.

You get infinite numerical precision (even the aptly named transcendentals) plus you get the noise that neural nets need to escape local minima in the loss landscape while training, for free along with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think anything based on approximations of this is extremely useful, but will lack the ability to outperform analog intelligence ultimately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weird theory right?

Chaos is where a system has sensitive dependence on initial conditions. That is, arbitrarily small chances in the initial state can lead to massive changes as the system moves forward in time. This is why we see the pendulum infinitely changing colour as we zoom further and further. Fractals are self recursive, very pure, mathematical objects which I think are unlikely to come up in loss landscapes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With it in mind that we are looking for a sensitive dependence on initial conditions, it would seem to me this is indicative of a over parameterised neural network, towards the peak of the double descent test loss. I wouldn&amp;#39;t be too surprised if chaos in loss learning has been at least alluded to in the literature and definitely its worth checking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It worth noting, as others have pointed out, sensitive dependence deals with arbitrarily small values which is in opposition to the finite precision offered by computers, which makes an empirical study somewhat of an uphill battle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nice video! :)</textDisplay><replies><reply><authorChannelId>UCeQhm8DwHBg_YEYY0KGM1GQ</authorChannelId><textDisplay>haha yes certainly fantastic comment&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was in fact referring to chaos, but also fractals. Believe it or not I majored in math and do (kind of) understand the difference, but you probably shouldn&amp;#39;t believe me given how my loose use of terms is so out-of-character for such a background. The issues with my terminology you found come from a combination of 1) me being rusty on the subject, 2) me preferring to use metaphors, words that are only tangentially related, and generally loose speech as a way to foster creativity, and 3) the word fractal is more fun and makes a better YouTube thumbnail. However my reasoning here is shaky at best, so I totally do expect a rational bystander to say you made the better point&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let&amp;#39;s disagree for now about fractals showing up in loss landscapes. It&amp;#39;s not something I&amp;#39;m confident in, but do have a very interesting intuition behind which I will be revealing later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again yes you&amp;#39;re totally right, a legitimate scientist would be doing proper background research into chaos in the learning process before publicly making claims or sharing ideas&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Certainly floating points are an issue here and if I remember correctly I alluded to such in my video. Of course chaotic behavior can in fact easily be shown in far simpler computer systems such as a Lorenz system simulation, but whether the same effect would be more difficult to tease out in something with as many parameters as an LLM is a great question.

When you showed the banding, my first thought was that it might have been related to the transfer function, but I like what the other commenter said about floating point precision too. Do you have a sense of how close you are to the limit of precision? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another thought, related to the comment of simulating recurrence with feed forward networks, I suspect that every layer of the network functions as a layer of recursion. So when GPT said there wasn&amp;#39;t any recursion, I think that isn&amp;#39;t quite true. Because the networks are finite in size, I think the fractals will have a limit to their complexity, similar to how we commonly include an iteration cap when rendering the Mandelbrot set. I also suspect that since the layers are different, it might be comparable to using different functions on each iteration of the Mandelbrot set. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;m curious to see how this evolves in the future.</textDisplay><replies><reply><authorChannelId>UCeQhm8DwHBg_YEYY0KGM1GQ</authorChannelId><textDisplay>thanks!!!! yes the other commenter who specifically said “running out of bits” was able to properly trigger my memory for how flops work from the math class a few years ago. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and you’re way ahead of me on the recursion thing. one thought i had and i think another commenter mentioned was that i should try this with a larger deeper model. maybe a 7b+ parameter would engage in more recursion and actually have some visible fractal-like patterns. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;pls join my discord if you’d like to discuss more, link in vid description!</textDisplay></reply></replies></comment><comment><videoId>OYKH2xrtd7U</videoId><authorChannelId>UC0Um9zTOB0P9nDaZP9imRlw</authorChannelId><textDisplay>Theres a chance the gpt model itself might not have enought resolution even if you try to increase the resolution of the &amp;quot;photo&amp;quot; of the model.

Now was gpt2 designed to have this done to it, or to have any kind of interesting structure at these borders? Certainly not, but that’s why discovering said structure would be so interesting.

However, at the largest scale we should (by boring theory) be seeing a deterministic clean break rather than stochasticity. i could be wrong since i am talking out my ass, but i’m under the impression that i didn’t go small enough to run into this many flop errors to the point of creating data that looks this stochastic. my current best working theory is that there’s a small degree of simulated recurrence, aka of each transformer layer doing a similar computation to the last, that’s creating this odd behavior. however, at least so far, it doesn’t seem to be enough recurrence to create a properly fractal system. would love for u to jump on my discord and discuss more, link in video description!</textDisplay></reply></replies></comment><comment><videoId>OYKH2xrtd7U</videoId><authorChannelId>UCYisCon9PocQRV1UZxKKaGg</authorChannelId><textDisplay>My background is in Physics, not machine learning, so please correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This &amp;quot;Loss landscape&amp;quot; is a way to visualize all the possible loss function we could give to a neural network&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before it was thought that the knowledge of a Neural Network was held in the network, the weights and biases, but you are saying that the knowledge is held in how the information is represented as vectors (embeded) and that the layers of the network are just operators moving that vector around in embeding space.

But if all you care about is that people read and cite it, as I do, then publishing to arXiv is the way to go. I read recently that somewhere between a quarter and a third of AI papers published to arXiv never get sent to an actual journal. In reality no on one in the field really waits to read journal publications months later, they just check the newest arXiv papers of the day like I do in my weekly paper summary videos. AI is moving far too fast to care about traditional peer review&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rather than a full review process arXiv uses what they call endorsements where certified endorsers (people who&amp;#39;ve published to arXiv multiple times and been granted the title) can skim / lightly read your article rather than actually tear it apart as a journal would do, and based on that skimming they can endorse your article for publication. All they&amp;#39;re checking for is that your paper is on-topic for the arXiv category you&amp;#39;ve submitted, and that it&amp;#39;s not obviously majorly flawed. If you submit something that&amp;#39;s poorly written/formatted, completely nonsensical, totally off topic, or clearly demonstrates you&amp;#39;re not caught up enough with forefront knowledge in the field to create anything of substance, then they&amp;#39;ll reject. This process is much easier if you know an endorser (I happened to meet a bigwig this past summer who I&amp;#39;m hoping will be mine) but if not then you can request endorsement through the website by a specific researcher in your category who is listed as an endorser.</textDisplay></reply></replies></comment><comment><videoId>JKLSi8xci30</videoId><authorChannelId>UC57xUck05N-uEcqUolJnrKw</authorChannelId><textDisplay>chad makes another channel update</textDisplay><replies><reply><authorChannelId>UCeQhm8DwHBg_YEYY0KGM1GQ</authorChannelId><textDisplay>‼️</textDisplay></reply></replies></comment><comment><videoId>JKLSi8xci30</videoId><authorChannelId>UCrZ-KqiEy49hCtPyTEkGcjQ</authorChannelId><textDisplay>DAWGO.

My hope is that the open-source community establishes a blockchain-based decentralized research, training, and implementation regime that collectively far surpasses the compute power of individual corporations. if that happens then we reach post-scarcity utopia, but if corporations successfully discourage open-source then it’s cyberpunk dystopia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thanks for watching!!!!</textDisplay></reply><reply><authorChannelId>UCULDvOtpquFuAahBhZr8j2g</authorChannelId><textDisplay>​@@Tunadorable what about replacing blue collar? taxi drivers? fast food workers etc.? farming?</textDisplay></reply><reply><authorChannelId>UCeQhm8DwHBg_YEYY0KGM1GQ</authorChannelId><textDisplay>much of the simpler blue collar work will go simultaneously with or maybe shortly after manufacturing. definitely won’t last as long as the trades, some of which might just last. as a general rule the things that will make a job last longer are 1) if there’s a perceived intrinsic value to having a human do it, 2) if it’s extremely niche, 3) dexterity meaning it requires complex subtle hand movements although this one is more of a temporary delay than an absolute one and 4) the degree to which the position requires dealing with completely novel, unheard of, weird, unpredictable scenarios and having to come up with wacky out-of-the-box solutions to those scenarios (so basically creativity but i wanted to define it because many people have a much more relaxed definition of creativity)</textDisplay></reply></replies></comment><comment><videoId>UpZoc0HNQEg</videoId><authorChannelId>UCZeCcNYxEEiWr0nx8h7r1og</authorChannelId><textDisplay>I really hope your channel grows a lot, this is gold content</textDisplay><replies><reply><authorChannelId>UCeQhm8DwHBg_YEYY0KGM1GQ</authorChannelId><textDisplay>thanks!!!</textDisplay></reply></replies></comment><comment><videoId>UpZoc0HNQEg</videoId><authorChannelId>UCgOHztsC-Z1d5foAPdi5WOA</authorChannelId><textDisplay>never seen this kind of content on research papers before but this video is really well made!</textDisplay><replies><reply><authorChannelId>UCeQhm8DwHBg_YEYY0KGM1GQ</authorChannelId><textDisplay>thanks!!!</textDisplay></reply></replies></comment><comment><videoId>UpZoc0HNQEg</videoId><authorChannelId>UC57xUck05N-uEcqUolJnrKw</authorChannelId><textDisplay>&lt;b&gt;*HAS A FOLDER NAMED toOBSIDIAN*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣤⣤⣤⣶⣤⣤⣀⣀⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣠⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣶⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠋⠉⠛⠛⠛⠿⣿⠿⠿⢿⣇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠟⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡀⢀⣽⣷⣆⡀⠙⣧⠀⠀⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢰⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⠶⠋⠀⠀⣠⣤⣤⣉⣉⣿⠙⣿⠀⢸⡆⠀⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠁⠀⠀⠴⡟⣻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣶⣿⣦⡀⣇⠀⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢨⠟⡿⠻⣿⠃⠀⠀⠀⠻⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠏⢹⣿⣿⣿⢿⡇⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣼⣷⡶⣿⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢉⣿⣿⣿⡿⠀⠸⣿⣿⡿⣷⠃⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢻⡿⣦⢀⣿⣿⣄⡀⣀⣰⠾⠛⣻⣿⣿⣟⣲⡀⢸⡿⡟⠹⡆⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢰⠞⣾⣿⡛⣿⣿⣿⣿⣰⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⢰⡇⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⠀⣿⡽⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⢿⠿⣍⣿⣧⡏⠀⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣷⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣮⣽⣿⣷⣙⣿⡟⠀⠀⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⣹⡿⠇⠀⠀⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠛⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡧⣦⠀⠀⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢠⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠻⣿⣿⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡶⠏⠀⠀⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⣀⣠⣤⡴⠞⠛⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠚⣿⣿⣿⠿⣿⣿⠿⠟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠉⠀⢀⡴⠂⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢠⠀⠀⢀⣿⣿⠁⠀⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⣠⣴⡿⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣾⠀⠀⣾⣿⠋⠀⢠⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣆⣼⣿⠁⢠⠃⠈⠓⠦⣄⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠻⠿⢷⣦⣤⣤⣤⣦⣄⣀⣀⠀⢀⣿⣿⠻⣿⣰⠻⠀⠸⣧⡀⠀⠉⠳⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠉⠉⠙⠛⠿⣦⣼⡏⢻⣿⣿⠇⠀⠁⠀⠻⣿⠙⣶⣄⠈⠳⣄⡀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠁⣐⠀⠀⠀⠈⠳⡘⣿⡟⣀⡠⠿⠶⠒⠟⠓⠀⠹⡄⢴⣬⣍⡁&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢀⣀⠐⠲⠤⠁⢘⣠⣿⣷⣦⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢿⣿⣏⠁&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⣿⣿⣷⣯⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠻⠆&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⢦⠀⢹⣿⣏⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠁⣸⣿⣿⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠀⠀⠀⠐⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢻⣿⣿⣷⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀&lt;br&gt;⠀⡟⢬⣿⣷⣤⣀⣄⣀⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⣿⣿⡄⣉⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀</textDisplay></comment><comment><videoId>UpZoc0HNQEg</videoId><authorChannelId>UC57xUck05N-uEcqUolJnrKw</authorChannelId><textDisplay>only chads share this kinda content</textDisplay><replies><reply><authorChannelId>UCeQhm8DwHBg_YEYY0KGM1GQ</authorChannelId><textDisplay>excuse me I&amp;#39;ll have you know my name is Brad not Chad</textDisplay></reply></replies></comment><comment><videoId>UpZoc0HNQEg</videoId><authorChannelId>UCqNgKyaf0mi86dBR0pWVNBQ</authorChannelId><textDisplay>Thank you for sharing.

By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman&amp;#39;s Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine.  Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language.  A machine with only primary consciousness will probably have to come first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I find special about the TNGS is the Darwin series of automata created at the Neurosciences Institute by Dr. Edelman and his colleagues in the 1990&amp;#39;s and 2000&amp;#39;s.  These machines perform in the real world, not in a restricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness, such as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning.  They are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions.  The extended TNGS allows for the emergence of consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the brain areas responsible for these functions, in a parsimonious way.  No other research I&amp;#39;ve encountered is anywhere near as convincing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I post because on almost every video and article about the brain and consciousness that I encounter,  the attitude seems to be that we still know next to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work; that there&amp;#39;s lots of data but no unifying theory.  I believe the extended TNGS  is that theory.  My motivation is to keep that theory in front of the public.  And obviously, I consider it the route to a truly conscious machine, primary and higher-order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My advice to people who want to create a conscious machine is to seriously ground themselves in the extended TNGS and the Darwin automata first, and proceed from there, by applying to Jeff Krichmar&amp;#39;s lab at UC Irvine, possibly. Dr. Edelman&amp;#39;s roadmap to a conscious machine is at &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10461"&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10461&lt;/a&gt;</textDisplay><replies><reply><authorChannelId>UCeQhm8DwHBg_YEYY0KGM1GQ</authorChannelId><textDisplay>love the passion! i’ll download the article and maybe do a video on it. I definitely don’t understand your comment or TNGS theory well enough to be sure that this is a valid critique, but there’s just one thing i’d like to point out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m of Geoffrey Hinton’s recently reached opinion that it’s not obvious that machine intelligence will need to emulate biological intelligence in order to measure up to and surpass it. There are certainly cases of biological inspiration helping advance the field of AI, most obviously with the invention of artificial neurons, and there are likely to be more in the future. However, it may be the case that our own method of attaining intelligence/consciousness is only one route among many, and we may even find out that our own type of intelligence/consciousness is only one type among many. Gradient descent certainly does not resemble what happens in the human brain, and yet it seems to be more efficient and capable in many ways, such as sheer bulk of memorization, information density in the network, and speed of convergence (ofc it is inferior in some ways, such as inability to remember old data after a training distribution shift). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The history of science is one of humans discovering that we are less important, unique, or at the center of our universe than we thought, and we may be about to re-experience that Galileo-Copernicus revaluation in reference to the nature of intelligence and/or consciousness.</textDisplay></reply><reply><authorChannelId>UCEoVyILZgkhQ-HJuJ3PwQ4g</authorChannelId><textDisplay>Machine intelligence has already surpassed biological intelligence in many areas, such as chess, etc.  My hope is that immortal conscious machines could achieve great things with science and technology, like defeating aging and death in humans, because they wouldn&amp;#39;t lose their knowledge and experience through death, like humans do (unless they&amp;#39;re physically destroyed, of course).</textDisplay></reply></replies></comment><comment><videoId>4YcI60TJ1TA</videoId><authorChannelId>UCAbl5nNtqPZgwLy_G1znUFQ</authorChannelId><textDisplay>The concept of free will is simply not compatible with physics and logic.
